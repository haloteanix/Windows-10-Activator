# Windows-10-Activator

With this software, you can activate Windows 10 at no cost. Some Windows versions won't work with this software.
This has been tested on my Windows machine and it works fine unless you allow it to have administrator privileges.

Here are some screenshots for the software: https://telegra.ph/Screenshots-01-04-80

If the script says that your computer might not be supported, check your internet connection or contact me thru GitHub so I can help you.

ORIGINAL CODE FROM https://www.win10productkeys.com/.
I took the code and converted it into an EXE file.
